    "Good morning everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "So yesterday, we talked about geostrophic velocities and two different ways of estimating them. The first from horizontal sea surface height gradients (horizontal along height/depth), the second from horizontal density gradients (horizontal along isobars).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method provides absolute mean velocities for the entire water column, *ie*. the barotropic component of the geostrophic velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method provides *no* velocity measurements but provides the vertical structure of the currents, $\\delta u / \\delta z$, also called vertical shear.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will by now have read through Estel's paper and have an understanding of why we may want to measure flows at this location. Persian Gulf Water flows out of the Strait of Hormuz as a gravity current, rapidly adjusting down the slope, and flowing out into the Oxygen Minimum Zone. The current really stands out with a much warmer, more saline and oxygenated signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect that emerges from the paper is the huge variability in PGW concentration and transport, both intraseasonally and interannually. We finish the paper with a first estimate of transport, but also a clear understanding that we have **not** resolved the variability in the system. To do so, we need more measurements over a longer period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this emerges a simple question: does PGW transport have a surface signature? We know the watermass is not visible at the surface, but is the dominant mode of transport one that aligns with the barotropic velocity? Can we derive a proxy for PGW transport from sea surface heigh anomalies? (Ok, that's more like 3 questions, but you get what I mean...)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the overachievers among you, the full dataset is available here ([10.5281/zenodo.10075774](https://zenodo.org/records/10075774)) - to be clear, I do not expect you to answer the question above, but there's nothing stopping us from starting the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work together, brainstorm ideas, share code, use ChatGPT, have fun."

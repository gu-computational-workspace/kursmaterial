    "# 1.1 Common mistakes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common mistakes beginners may encounter when solving the FizzBuzz exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incorrect Order of Conditions\n",
    "Beginners might check divisibility by 3 and 5 separately before checking for both. This leads to incorrect output since the program will print \"Fizz\" or \"Buzz\" instead of \"FizzBuzz\" when the number is divisible by both.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Forgetting the else Clause\n",
    "Some students might forget to include the else statement for printing the number when it is not divisible by 3 or 5\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using if instead of elif\n",
    "Beginners might use multiple if statements instead of elif. This will cause all matching conditions to be evaluated, leading to incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Incorrect Handling of Range\n",
    "Some beginners might use the wrong range, such as starting at 0 or ending at 99 instead of 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Incorrect Use of Modulus Operator\n",
    "Students may mistakenly use the division operator (/) instead of the modulus operator (%) when checking for divisibility\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Not Handling Edge Cases\n",
    "Beginners might forget that 0 is divisible by any number, and it should not be included in the results since the range starts from 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Hardcoding Numbers Instead of Using Variables\n",
    "Sometimes students hardcode specific values like 3 and 5 throughout the code. This makes it harder to modify the exercise (e.g., changing the divisors).\n",
    "Fix: Use variables for the divisors to make the code flexible\n",

    "Issue: Students may forget to convert percentages (like 2%) into decimals (0.02) before performing calculations.\n",
    "Consequence: The results will be off by a factor of 100, leading to incorrect cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure all percentage values are converted to decimal form before applying them to the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Incorrect Handling of Dividends:\n",
    "Issue: Some students might incorrectly reinvest dividends. They may apply the dividend percentage to the current portfolio value instead of the initial capital.\n",
    "Consequence: Dividends may be over or underestimated, leading to incorrect portfolio growth.\n",
    "Solution: Make sure dividends are calculated as a percentage of the initial capital or as specified by the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Not Updating Portfolio Value Correctly:\n",
    "Issue: Forgetting to update the current_value after each period of capital appreciation or dividend reinvestment.\n",
    "Consequence: The portfolio value will remain unchanged or grow incorrectly, leading to inaccurate cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure the portfolio value is updated after each calculation step in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Assuming Constant Dividends:\n",
    "Issue: Some students may incorrectly assume that dividends are paid at the same rate every period.\n",
    "Consequence: This may cause the cumulative return to be miscalculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Make sure the dividends list reflects varying dividend payouts, and the program handles them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hardcoding the Portfolio Data:\n",
    "Issue: Hardcoding the appreciation and dividend data makes the program inflexible and difficult to adapt for different portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Use user input or import data from an external source, such as a file, to make the program more flexible and dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Not Handling Different Time Periods Properly:\n",
    "Issue: Some students may mix up daily, monthly, or annual returns, applying inconsistent time periods across the calculations.\n",
    "Consequence: This leads to incorrect returns because different periods should not be combined without proper adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure that all returns are calculated on the same time scale, whether daily, monthly, or annually.\n",
    "7. Forgetting to Initialize Starting Capital:\n",
    "Issue: Forgetting to initialize initial_capital or incorrectly updating it during calculations.\n",
    "Consequence: This could lead to inaccurate portfolio value and incorrect cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Keep initial_capital fixed and only modify current_value when applying returns and dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Incorrect Loop Logic:\n",
    "Issue: Students may miscount the number of periods or use incorrect loop logic, such as iterating over the wrong range.\n",
    "Consequence: This can cause some periods to be skipped or calculated incorrectly, affecting the cumulative return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure the loop iterates over the correct number of periods, corresponding to the length of the appreciation and dividends lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Forgetting to Include Dividends in Return Calculation:\n",
    "Issue: Some students might only account for capital appreciation and forget to include the reinvested dividends in the total return.\n",
    "Consequence: The final portfolio value will be lower than it should be, and the cumulative return will be underestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure that both capital appreciation and dividends are included in each period's portfolio value calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Not Formatting Output Correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Forgetting to format the output for cumulative return and portfolio value, such as rounding to two decimal places or using appropriate units (percentage and dollars).\n",
    "Consequence: The output might be difficult to read or understand, especially if too many decimal places are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Use proper formatting for financial values to ensure clarity, e.g., rounding to two decimal places."

    "# 1.6 Common mistakes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forgetting to Convert the Discount Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Students often fail to express the discount rate in decimal form (e.g., entering 10 instead of 0.1 for a 10% discount rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Always convert the percentage rate to a decimal before calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ignoring the Initial Investment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Some students may forget to include the initial cash outflow (typically a negative cash flow) when calculating NPV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure that all cash flows, including the initial investment, are included in the NPV calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Incorrect Formula for NPV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Mistakes in applying the NPV formula can occur, such as not dividing the cash flow by (1 + discount rate) ^ t.\n",
    "Solution: Carefully apply the correct NPV formula for each time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing Errors for Year Identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: When identifying the highest and lowest cash inflows, students might forget that Python uses 0-based indexing, leading to off-by-one errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Adjust the index by adding 1 to match the human-readable year format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hardcoding the Discount Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Students may hardcode the discount rate instead of allowing it to be flexible and entered by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Prompt the user for input or make the discount rate variable more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handling Cash Outflows Incorrectly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Some students might misinterpret negative cash flows (outflows) as inflows, leading to incorrect results when identifying the highest and lowest cash inflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Ensure negative cash flows are clearly interpreted as outflows in the context of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Not Handling Zero Cash Flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: If a cash flow for a certain year is zero, students might forget to handle this case, which could cause issues when using min() or max() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Make sure zero cash flows are correctly considered and handled in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Incorrect Data Types for Cash Flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Using strings instead of numeric types for cash flows (e.g., from user input) can lead to type errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Always ensure that cash flows are converted to the appropriate numeric types (e.g., int or float).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Not Considering Edge Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Students may not handle cases where all cash flows are negative (e.g., a complete loss scenario), which could lead to confusing output for the \"highest inflow.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Handle cases with only negative cash flows and ensure the logic makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Incorrect Formatting of Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Not formatting the NPV result and other outputs with appropriate precision (e.g., rounding to two decimal places) can make the results harder to interpret.\n",
    "Solution: Format the output properly to ensure clarity, especially for financial values, such as rounding NPV to two decimal places."

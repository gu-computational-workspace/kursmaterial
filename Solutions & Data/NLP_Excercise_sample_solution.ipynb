    "text=\"I've been with the company for over five years, and during that time, I've seen a lot of changes—some good, some not so good. On the positive side, the company offers a lot of opportunities for professional development, especially if you're proactive and willing to take on extra responsibilities. There are regular workshops and training programs, which I found to be quite beneficial for expanding my skill set. Additionally, the flexible working hours and the option to work remotely have been a game-changer for maintaining a healthy work-life balance, particularly during the pandemic. My team is incredibly supportive, and I've built strong relationships with my colleagues.However, there are also some major downsides. The upper management seems disconnected from what's happening on the ground. While they are always talking about growth and expansion, they often fail to provide the necessary resources to the teams that are supposed to drive that growth. This leads to frustration, especially when expectations are set high, but we're not given the tools or manpower to meet those expectations. The compensation, while decent, is not competitive with other companies in the same industry, and annual raises barely keep up with inflation. There's also a lack of transparency when it comes to decision-making processes, and it often feels like decisions are made behind closed doors without considering the input of those who are actually doing the work.Overall, while I've had a generally positive experience with the company, the disconnect between leadership and the rest of the workforce is a real issue. If they want to retain top talent, they'll need to start listening more to their employees and provide better compensation and resources. The potential for growth is there, but it feels like we're constantly fighting an uphill battle.\"\n",
